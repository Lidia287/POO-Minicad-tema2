ShapeFactory
Painter 
Main


Explanation : 
Shape - base class from which i extends the others :

Canvas : the class in which i use singleton pattern , it contains the image 

Line - i created a set method , to be able to use it when i draw the lines for 
	the other forms

Other classes constructors receive a string = line that was read and parse 
	it to complete the object's characteristics


ShapeFactory - the class in which i used factory principle 

Painter - flood fill iterative with queue - using 2 queues for the x and y , 
	check on 4 directions - the target color is the border color , 
	which if reached it stops, and the replacement is the inside color 
	given in the input ; every time , flood fill checks if the 
	current pixel verified matches the target color

draw for circle - using Bresenham algorithm 


draw for rectangle and square : the filling of color is done with 2 fors
